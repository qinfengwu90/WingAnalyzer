# WingAnalyzer

WingAnalyzer takes in wing images and their corresponding segmentation masks generated by a trained Ilastik model, and identifies specific morphological features from the wing in the image. In particular, WingAnalyzer identifies the L1-L5 veins, ACV, and PCV, plus the intervein regions.
